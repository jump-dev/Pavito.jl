# Pavito

Pavito is a **mixed-integer convex programming** (MICP) solver package written
in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). MICP problems are convex, except for
restrictions that some variables take binary or integer values.

Pavito solves MICP problems by constructing sequential polyhedral
outer-approximations of the convex feasible set, similar to
[Bonmin](https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin). Pavito accesses state-of-the-art
MILP solvers and continuous, derivative-based nonlinear programming (NLP)
solvers through the [MathOptInterface interface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl).

For algorithms that use a conic solver instead of an NLP solver, use
[Pajarito](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl). Pajarito is a robust
mixed-integer conic solver that can handle such established problem classes as
mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) and mixed-integer
semidefinite programming (MISDP).

## Installation

Install Pavito using `Pkg.add`:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pavito")
```

## Usage

There are several convenient ways to model MICPs in Julia and access Pavito:

JuMP and Convex.jl are algebraic modeling interfaces, while MathOptInterface is
a lower-level interface for providing input in raw callback or matrix form.

Convex.jl is perhaps the most user-friendly way to provide input in conic form,
since it transparently handles conversion of algebraic expressions.

JuMP supports general nonlinear smooth functions, e.g. by using `@NLconstraint`.
JuMP also supports conic modeling, but requires cones to be explicitly
specified, e.g. by using `@constraint(model, [t; x] in SecondOrderCone())` for
second-order cone constraints.

## MIP and continuous solvers

The algorithm implemented by Pavito itself is relatively simple; most of the
hard work is performed by the MILP solver and the NLP solver.

**The performance of Pavito depends on these two types of solvers.**

The mixed-integer solver is specified by using the `mip_solver` option to
`Pavito.Optimizer`, e.g.
`optimizer_with_attributes(Pavito.Optimizer, "mip_solver" => CPLEX.Optimizer)`.
You must first load the Julia package which provides the mixed-integer solver,
e.g. `using CPLEX`.

The continuous derivative-based nonlinear solver (e.g.
[Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt) or
[KNITRO](https://www.artelys.com/solvers/knitro/)) is specified by using the
`cont_solver` option, e.g.
`optimizer_with_attributes(Pavito.Optimizer, "cont_solver" => Ipopt.Optimizer)`.

MIP and continuous solver parameters must be specified through their
corresponding Julia interfaces. For example, to turn off the output of Ipopt
solver, use
`"cont_solver" => optimizer_with_attributes(Ipopt.Optimizer, "print_level" => 0)`.

## Pavito solver options

The following optimizer attributes can set to a `Pavito.Optimizer` to modify its
behavior:

  * `log_level::Int` Verbosity flag: 0 for quiet, higher for basic solve info
  * `timeout::Float64` Time limit for algorithm (in seconds)
  * `rel_gap::Float64` Relative optimality gap termination condition
  * `mip_solver_drives::Bool` Let MILP solver manage convergence ("branch and
    cut")
  * `mip_solver::MathOptInterface.AbstractMathProgSolver` MILP solver
  * `cont_solver::MathOptInterface.AbstractMathProgSolver` Continuous NLP solver

**Pavito is not yet numerically robust and may require tuning of parameters to
improve convergence.**

If the default parameters don't work for you, please let us know by opening an
issue.

For improved Pavito performance, MILP solver integrality tolerance and
feasibility tolerances should typically be tightened, for example to `1e-8`.
