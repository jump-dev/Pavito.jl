# Pavito

Pavito is a **mixed-integer convex programming** (MICP) solver package written
in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). MICP problems are convex, except for
restrictions that some variables take binary or integer values.

Pavito solves MICP problems by constructing sequential polyhedral
outer-approximations of the convex feasible set, similar to
[Bonmin](https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin). Pavito accesses state-of-the-art
MILP solvers and continuous, derivative-based nonlinear programming (NLP)
solvers through the [MathOptInterface interface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl).

For algorithms that use a conic solver instead of an NLP solver, use
[Pajarito](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl). Pajarito is a robust
mixed-integer conic solver that can handle such established problem classes as
mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) and mixed-integer
semidefinite programming (MISDP).

## Installation

Install Pavito using `Pkg.add`:
```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pavito")
```

## Use with JuMP

To use Pavito with [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl), use
`Pavito.Optimizer`:
```julia
using JuMP, Pavito
import GLPK, Ipopt
model = Model(
    optimizer_with_attributes(
        Pavito.Optimizer,
        "mip_solver" => optimizer_with_attributes(GLPK.Optimizer),
        "cont_solver" =>
            optimizer_with_attributes(Ipopt.Optimizer, "print_level" => 0),
    ),
)
```

The algorithm implemented by Pavito itself is relatively simple; most of the
hard work is performed by the MILP solver passed as `mip_solver` and the NLP
solver passed as `cont_solver`.

**The performance of Pavito depends on these two types of solvers.**

For better performance, you should use a commercial MILP solver such as CPLEX
or Gurobi.

## Pavito solver options

The following optimizer attributes can set to a `Pavito.Optimizer` to modify its
behavior:

  * `log_level::Int` Verbosity flag: 0 for quiet, higher for basic solve info
  * `timeout::Float64` Time limit for algorithm (in seconds)
  * `rel_gap::Float64` Relative optimality gap termination condition
  * `mip_solver_drives::Bool` Let MILP solver manage convergence ("branch and
    cut")
  * `mip_solver::MOI.OptimizerWithAttributes` MILP solver
  * `cont_solver::MOI.OptimizerWithAttributes` Continuous NLP solver

**Pavito is not yet numerically robust and may require tuning of parameters to
improve convergence.**

If the default parameters don't work for you, please let us know by opening an
issue.

For improved Pavito performance, MILP solver integrality tolerance and
feasibility tolerances should typically be tightened, for example to `1e-8`.
